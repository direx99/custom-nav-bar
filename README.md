# custom-nav-bar

ðŸš€ Exciting Update! ðŸ“¢

As a passionate self-study React Native developer, I've taken up a daily challenge to enhance my skills and broaden my knowledge. Today, I delved into the fascinating world of UI design on 'Dribble' and decided to put my skills to the test by redesigning the interface using React Native.

I'm thrilled to share with you my very first daily challenge creation! For this challenge, I focused on crafting a set of custom bottom navigation bars using only React Native components. I wanted to challenge myself to rely solely on the built-in capabilities of React Native, without utilizing any third-party packages.

I'm eager to learn and grow from this experience, so I invite you to take a look at my work and provide your valuable insights. If you notice any areas for improvement or have suggestions, I would greatly appreciate your input. Your feedback will undoubtedly contribute to my knowledge and expertise in React Native.

Stay tuned for more exciting daily challenges as I continue to explore and expand my skills. Thank you for your support and engagement on this incredible journey!
